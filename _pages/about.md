I am a second year electrical engineering student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in a range of topics, including analog electroncis, digital systems, and software development. I enjoy applying engineering design principles when planning and working on projects. If you click on the [Projects](https://zaeem-ahmad.github.io/projects/) page, you will find moderately in-depth descriptions of my projects and initiatives. You can also see my JSON [résumé](https://zaeem-ahmad.github.io/cv/).

The above notwithstanding, I also have a knack for reading all genres of fiction, from epic fantasies and thrillers to contemporary and historical fiction. I am also invested in the study of languages, religion, and history. I enjoy playing basketball, going on bike rides, and taking walks with my friends. 

If you want to get in touch (or have some tea with me), feel free to email me.
